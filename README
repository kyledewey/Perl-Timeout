A simplified version of the UNIX timeout command.  It is used like so:

./timeout.pl <integer specifying duration in minutes> <command> <arg1...>

I've found that the typical UNIX timeout command under Linux doesn't
behave quite right when run non-interactively.  Specifically, it will
spawn the process, appear to put the process to sleep, and then wait until
the timeout expires. This is clearly no good.  Perl-Timeout doesn't have
this issue, and it was faster to write Perl-Timeout than to figure out
this bizarre behavior for UNIX timeout.
